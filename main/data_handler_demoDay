class DataHandler_demo():
    """
    This class is made to act as a client to read data
    from a UART enabled GPIO pins 15,16 and convert to SpO2
    in order to simulate real-time changing SpO2 data.
    
    Requires disabling the serial-console login because 
    GPIO 15,16 are by default used for this.
    
    Chad and I have decided for now it might be easier to 
    just make a slider function on the screen that
    would allow manipulation of incoming SpO2 data.
